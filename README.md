# Posture reminder

This is a quick reoccurring timer that I made. It is intended to remind you of your posture but it can be used for anything really  
For example, you can use it to remind yourself to:  
> - Have a water break
> - Walk around
> - Exercise
> - Touch Grass   

Don't question the alarm sounds too much and enjoy!   
 
# Installation  

1. Download all files into a single folder
2. Run the run.bat file to start the program

Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed or else it will **not** work.

# Usage

Usage is pretty straight forward. The program is going to ask you to choose one of 3 options.
> - \[1\]  Quick Start: Immediately starts the timer based on your default settings.
> - \[2\]  Manual Start: Manually enter your preferred settings.
> - \[3\]  Settings: Change default settings and preview alarm sounds.
